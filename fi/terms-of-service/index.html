<p>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Uniqul Account and the Uniqul Services (or longer if pursuant to a court order or other legal process) if you violate the User Agreement or any other agreement you enter into with Uniqul, or as may be otherwise specified in this Agreement.</p>
<p>If after reading this Agreement in its entirety you are still unsure of anything or you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at support@Uniqul.com.</p>
<p>If you want to have a Uniqul account, these are the rules that you and Uniqul need to follow. Incorporating the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and E-Sign Consent “by reference” means that by agreeing to this User Agreement you are also subject to those policies.</p>
<p>We may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on our website.</p>
<p>Uniqul is Only a Payment Service Provider</p>
<p>Uniqul helps you make payments to, and accept payments from, third parties through face recognition. Uniqul is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee. Your account is not a bank account.</p>

<p>Privacy</p>
<p>Privacy is very important to us. Uniqul’s Privacy Policy regarding collection, use and sharing of Information can be found on www.uniqul.com.</p>
<p>When you use the Services, you agree that we may provide you with any Communications in electronic format</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>You must be an individual of at least 18 years of age and reside within the European Union to enter into this Agreement. Use of certain Services may have further eligibility requirements that will need to be verified prior to you using such Services.</p>
<p>We may also not provide all or some of our Services to certain persons or regions if, for example, in doing so, we would not be able to comply with the laws relating to our Services in such circumstances.</p>
<p>You may open only one Uniqul account. If you attempt to open more than one account, such additional account(s) may be suspended or terminated. Payments which are carried out through the Service should be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Registration and personal data</p>
<p>When registering for your account, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information. If any of this information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible. From time to time, we may also require you to provide further information as a condition for continued use of the Services so that we can confirm your identity. We reserve the right to maintain your account registration information after you close your account for business and regulatory compliance purposes. Data that has been maintained after account closure can only be accessed for business and regulatory compliance purposes and will be wiped completely as soon as these requirements cease to exist.</p>
<p>All of the registration data will be saved in the personal data registry of Uniqul Oy. Data and documentation pertaining to this registry can be accessed on our website. Registry data will be shared with third parties when required by law or when processing your purchases.</p>
<p>Biometric data</p>
<p>Upon a QPoint registration your facial characteristics will be stored in Uniqul’s database. This data represents a mathematical model of your facial characteristics and is encrypted. This biometrical data will be stored within the EU but can be accessed worldwide. If you wish to use the Uniqul service only within the European Union please contact us separately at support@Uniqul.com. Biometric data cannot be accessed by third parties other than our hosting partners. Biometric data will be used solely to access Uniqul’s Services and will not be shared with any other entities.</p>
<p>Security of User Information</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any and all account names, user IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), and mobile unlock codes that you can use to access the Services. You agree to notify Uniqul immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of the Services or any other breach of security regarding the Services at support@uniqul.com. Uniqul will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account information.</p>
<p>Theft</p>
<p>In the event that any balance held in your account is stolen as a result of a direct breach of Uniqul’s digital or physical storage facilities you will be reimbursed fully. If your balance is lost or stolen as a result of your own failure to maintain proper security protocols in accordance with Section 6, such loss is not covered by Uniqul and not reimbursed. Your account is not covered by any government-backed deposit insurance scheme.</p>
<p>Unauthorized access</p>
<p>Unregistered users are not permitted to use the service and any attempts to do so will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Note that even unsuccessful attempts, for example attempting to log into an account by guessing PINs, are prosecuted. All of the necessary data linked to unauthorized access will be shared with local law enforcement.</p>
<p>Blacklisting</p>
<p>Unregistered user’s attempts to access the system will result in anonymized enrollment in a watch list database. Multiple attempts will result in blacklisting and logging of all data in regards to this incident.</p>
<p>Account Suspension &amp; Closure</p>
<p>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Uniqul Account and the Uniqul Services (or longer if pursuant to a court order or other legal process) if you violate the User Agreement or any other agreement you enter into with Uniqul, or as may be otherwise specified in this Agreement. Temporary suspension is also possible in case of security concerns.</p>
<p>Please note that any attempts made to access your account might lead to escalating the security threshold of your account. This might also be a result of you inputting your PIN code incorrectly. Incorrect PIN input will not automatically lead to account suspension but the security of the account will be tracked and enforced more closely</p>
<p>If you have a remaining account balance which has been suspended or closed, you will be able to access and withdraw the funds to a bank account (unless prohibited by law or a court order). If you are unable to login to your account because it has been suspended, you must contact us at support@uniqul.com to process such withdrawal. We reserve the right to require you to provide further identifying information before processing such withdrawal or transfer.</p>

We may, at our sole discretion, delay purchases or withdrawals if we believe the transaction is suspicious, may involve fraud, violates applicable laws or violates the terms of this Agreement.</p>
