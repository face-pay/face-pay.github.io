      <p style="text-align: left;">World&#8217;s first face recognition payment system.</p>
<p>Press release. Free to publication on July 15th 2013 at 11:00.</p>
<p>Uniqul is the world’s first face recognition payment system. It enables customers to pay without having a wallet, card or mobile phone.<br />
We decided to take convenience to a whole new level. Imagine going in to a kiosk, picking up a newspaper at the cashier, clicking “Ok” on a Uniqul tablet and walking away. Imagine a day at the beach when you don’t have to think about where to store your wallet during your swims. Imagine a new form of payments.</p>
<p>We are using military grade algorithms to make sure that the security of our system is impeccable. We have written and improved our program so that it can perform everything in the blink of an eye. We have developed an user friendly interface and made the system easy to use. All of this comes down to a user experience which consists of a user merely clicking “Ok” on our tablet. In the background our algorithms are processing your biometrical data to find your account in our database as you are approaching the cashier. The whole transaction will be done in less than 5 seconds – the time it usually takes you to pull out your wallet.</p>
<p>We believe that we have developed the most secure and convenient payment system available and we have managed this while also bringing down the transaction time from the average of ca. 30 seconds to less than 5 seconds. You can use all the major credit cards when registering a payment method on your Uniqul account.<br />
Uniqul gives merchants the chance to know its customers – leading to a more personalized and enjoyable shopping experience. We are very glad to bring you these news and we at Uniqul are looking forward to provide you with your most enjoyable shopping experience yet.</p>
<p>As for the pricing of our product we wanted to keep the customer in charge and that means that the individual users will be paying a monthly subscription fee as follows: As most people mainly visit shops near their work and home we decided to set the first fee level, 0.99€, to a 1-2 km radius from an user chosen point. Radius is dependent on the number of Uniqul terminals within the area. The next level, 1.99€, covers a specified city and is perfect for users who live and work within the same city, but want to use Uniqul in a wider area. The third level, 2.99€, covers a city and nearby suburbs, and is ideal for commuters who want the shopping convenience of Uniqul both when grocery shopping close to home and when buying lunch at work. The last level, 6.99€, is targeted towards frequent travelers who want total freedom from their wallet, and covers worldwide use of Uniqul.</p>
<p>We are finalizing our product and getting ready for deployment in the Helsinki area.</p>
